This is planned to be open sourced. It's based on concepts I learned while working on Studio 5 at Zynga, and I tried to build it so they could re-integrate with it if wanted, while adding flexibility and legibility. It is meant as a hardcore vanilla based replacment to things like jQuery / Zepto / App.js, and gives a very powerful and flexible toolkit to people who know how to use it.
